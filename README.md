# Developed and managed by Nishant Maheshwari from LPU

# analogusUMS_for_LPU

Analogus UMS( University Management System ) is a analogus version of UMS of LPU( Lovely Professional University ), Where students can access their UMS information from university, like User Profile, Announcements, Messages, Grades, Marks, Classes, Datesheet anywhere in an very user furiendly and interactive way apart from traditional UMS.

This modularized interface first require "Registration-id" and "Password" of UMS to login and to 
access data using API's of LPU.

[ Problem we have solved here ] : As traditional UMS is very heavy and experiences very large traffic on it, due to which there is huge load on datacenter, which causes delay in accessing information at critical time. So this is my initiative to make UMS easily accssible in a furnished manner.



@ Steps to access the Information:

@ First you need to have python3 installed in your system, to run the "host-api.py" file.
@ There Both credentials are required , then it will get fetch the data from PyPi and host an api on local server.
@ Then you can Run 'index.html' file to access the webpage.


*(This is development phase, so we would be updating and adding functionalities constantly)*
